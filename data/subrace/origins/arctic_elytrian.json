  "name": "Arctic Elytrian",
  "description": "A kind of Elytrians adapted to the freezing cold. Their wings big and heavy with dense feathers, to survive they had to abandon their life of flying through the skies and to huddle in small spaces to stay warm causing them to grow dense bones and to overcome their claustrophobia, but losing their ability to launch into the sky."
