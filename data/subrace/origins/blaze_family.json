  "description": "What happens to those humans that get stranded in the Nether for long periods of time? The existence of this species are the answer. Blaze Spawners of modern day are tame to what they used to eons ago, humans that came close to these spawners were nearly killed, however those who survived haven't been the same sense. This race originates from the Nether, making them adapted to the Nether's perils."
