# Origins-Sub-Races
A datapack add-on for the Origins mod that adds sub-races to the original 10 origins.

Supports both Forge & Fabric Versions of the Origins mod for Minecraft 1.16.5. Will possibly add support for 1.17.1 if I think I should.

### What this datapack does in a nutshell.
Inspired by games such as D&D, this datapack adds a whole new layer of customization to Origins. Instead of choosing a Origin first, you choose which family your Origin is from, for example the **Elytrian Family**, or the **Blaze Family**.

After choosing which family your desired Origin will be from. (Make sure your choice is correct as once you pick a family, you cannot change it) You can choose one of the three sub-races to be your Origin, two of the sub-races are entirely unique while one of them is the original Origin from the base mod under a new name. Each Sub-race has unique gameplay and lore for each one. (And lore for the entire family for others)

This datapack adds a total of 19 unqiue origins (29 if you count the original origins) spread across 10 different families!
